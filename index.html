                                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and

                                unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                                passages, and more recently with desktop publishing

                                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
                                simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                                classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
                                it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                                Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
                                Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
                                Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                                passage, and going through the cites of the
                                word in classical literature, discovered the
                                undoubtable source.
